# Sydney-Airbnb

This interactive dashboard helps policymakers and residents understand the impacts of Airbnb on Sydney neighbourhoods. 

It can be accessed here: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYmI4N2ZhZTYtMDQwMS00NTg3LTlkMTQtYzRiOTY5ZWU5MTg1IiwidCI6ImI2ZTM3N2NmLTlkYjMtNDZjYi05MWEyLWZhZDk2MDViYjE1YyJ9

Context: A 2015 NSW Parliamentary Inquiry found concerns that Airbnb was increasing congestion, reducing the supply of permanent rental housing and increasing rental prices across Sydney. In 2018, NSW Government proposed regulatory reforms that would limit Airbnb lettings to 180 nights a year when a host is not present. 

Insights: The dashboard estimates that across greater Sydney, there are 3578 potentially illegal listings under the proposed regulation, constituting 9% of the 38,337 total Airbnb listings for the city. The suburbs of Sydney, Waverley, and Randwick have the highest number of potentially illegal listings. (Potentially illegal listings are estimated to be let for over 180 nights per year as an entire home/apartment, suggesting the host is not present.)

The dashboard also calculates the ratio of highly available Airbnbs to vacant rental properties for each neighbourhood. Highly available listings are booked for more than 90 nights per year, suggesting that the owners may have listed the property on Airbnb as an alternative to the long-term rental market, reducing permanent rental supply in the area. For example, in Waverley, the number of dwellings frequently available on Airbnnb is more than 9 times the number of vacant rental properties in the area. While no causal claims can be made from the data, this implies that Airbnb rentals may be driving down the availability of permanent rental housing with consequent upwards pressure on rents.
